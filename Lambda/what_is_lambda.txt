Lambda is:
~ Data Centers
~ Hardware
~ Assembly Code/Protocols
~ High Level Languages
~ Operating Systems
~ Application Layer/AWS APIs
~ AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a compute service where youc an upload your code and create a Lambda function. AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code. 
You don't have to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling, etc. You can use Lambda in the following ways.
	- As an event-driven compute service where AWS Lambda runs your code in response to events. These events could be changes to data in a S3 bucket or a DynamoDB table. 
	You can also configure the Lambda to respond to requests to AWS API Gateway, or based on a timer triggered by AWS Cloudwatch.

	- As a compute service to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway or API calls made using AWS SDKs. This is what we use at A Cloud Guru.

Supported Languages: Node.js, Java, Python, C# and Go.

Priced: 1MM requests are free, 0.20$ per 1 million requests thereafter.

Duration: calculated from the time your code begins executing until it returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest 100ms. 
The price depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function. You are charged $0.0000167 for every GB-second used.

NO SERVERS, Continuous Scaling, Super cheap.

Lambda scales out(not up) automatically. You can run several functions in parallel, but if it runs out of memory, you will have to update the amount of memory for the lambda function.
Lambda functions are independent, 1 event = 1 function.
Lambda functions can trigger other lambda functions, 1 event can = x functions trigger other functions
Architectures can get extremely complicated, AWS X-ray allows you to debug what is happening.
Lambda can do things globally, you can use it to back up S3 buckets to other S3 buckets, etc.
